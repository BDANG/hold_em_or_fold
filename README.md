Bitcoin Arbitrage Opportunities (BAO)

Arbitrage is:
"the simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or commodities
in different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing
prices for the same asset."

The goal of the project is to use twilio to notify subscribers about possible bitcoin
arbitrage across the exchanges they personally utilize.

The project accounts for the buy/sell fees for each available exchange.

Assumes the user has significant equity in both BTC and USD on the exchanges they plan
to execute an arbitrage.
